# Hurwitz matrix criterion interface

This file records checked interface lemmas for the Hurwitz-matrix worker.  The
classical analytic theorem is not proved here; the point is to expose the exact
finite-minor statement needed by the existing `VeroneseSection` route.

This is the statement to target if one proves the classical theorem directly
from determinant formulas: every finite minor of the row-oriented Hurwitz
matrix attached to a Hurwitz-stable polynomial is nonnegative. -/
