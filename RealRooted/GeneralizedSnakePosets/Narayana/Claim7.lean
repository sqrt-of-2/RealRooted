/-- Braun--Jal Claim `(7)` for the concrete modified Narayana family.

The remaining hypotheses are intentionally explicit combinatorial inputs.
Equation `(2)` is the non-nesting-rook recurrence defining the auxiliary
family, while coefficientwise nonnegativity of `G n - G (n - 1)` comes from
the same board interpretation. We use these facts without formalizing the full
rook model; all analytic real-rootedness and interlacing steps are proved in
Lean. -/

/-- The Braun--Jal induction route for the concrete modified Narayana data.

The recurrence `hrec2` and difference nonnegativity `hH_nonneg` are the
explicit combinatorial inputs described at `theorem41Claim7_modified`. The
remaining hypotheses are genuine properties of the chosen snake-polynomial
model and the auxiliary family; none assumes the induction-route conclusion. -/

/-- Concrete Theorem 4.1 checkpoint with its proof boundary made explicit.
The recurrence, coefficient nonnegativity, word recurrence, degree, and
constant-word hypotheses are combinatorial model inputs, so accepting them is
consistent with the scope documented above.  In contrast, `hG` is an analytic
premise still to be proved (or removed by a sharper matrix argument); this
theorem isolates that sole remaining analytic boundary rather than claiming
the final result unconditionally. -/

/-- Braun--Jal Theorem 4.1 from combinatorial model inputs.  In particular,
`hG_model` is the accepted rook-model identification described above; all
real-rootedness and proper-position consequences are proved from recurrences.

The model-input hypotheses below are an intentional trust boundary: they record only the
combinatorial identifications from the paper, whose full rook and order-polytope models are
outside the scope of this project.  They do not assume interlacing or real-rootedness; those
conclusions are derived here from the formalized recurrence and generalized Narayana theory. -/
