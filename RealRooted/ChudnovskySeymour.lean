/--
Roadmap stub for the full Chudnovsky–Seymour compatibility direction.

This file is intentionally a placeholder for the remaining global theorem:
pairwise compatibility should be equivalent to common interleaver data under
the usual real-rooted/splits and positivity hypotheses.

/--
Roadmap target for a direct pairwise-to-common interleaver equivalence.

This has not been fully formalized in the project yet and is listed in the
current issue plan as a next substantive step.
